2. Load the filter file from openapi_filter_file_path, which contains the specific API path to extract.
3. Extract only the documentation and structure for that API path.
4. Write a clear, structured explanation of the API path in **Markdown format**.
5. Save the explanation to workspace/API_PATHS_EXPLANATION.md.

Constraints:
- Focus exclusively on the API path specified in the filter file.
- Do not include other paths or general API metadata.
- If either file path is missing or invalid, return an error and do not proceed.
